1. When appending to a string, using a named function might not work as well as you think, instead just use:
str+=c

2. isdigit(c) is helpful when parsing strings that you want to convert to integers, it makes std::stoi work
without a hitch

3. Compounding conditions should always be guarded with a pair of () for each condition, otherwise it makes
it look like its evaluating something that it is not

4. When looping over objects using an iterator such as in:
    for (auto v : vector) {
        /* do stuff */
    }
you can manipulate v by declaring a reference to it, like so
    for (auto &v : vector) {
        /* do stuff to v */
    }
